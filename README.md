# Dog Breed Clicky Game 

## Description 

This memory game was created using React by breaking up the application's UI into components, states, and responses to user events. 

## Usage 
- This application will render different images of different dog breeds. Each image will listen for a click event from the user. 
- The application keeps track of the user's score everytime the user clicks on a unique image which increments the total score by 1. However, if the user clicks on the same image twice, the user's score will reset to 0. 
- After an image is clicked, the images are scuffled and re-rendered on the page to challenge the user's memory. The images are scuffled randomly. 
- If the user clicks on the same image twice, their score will reset and the game will start over. 
- If a top score is reached during a game, that top score will be stored in that browser until it has been refreshed.
